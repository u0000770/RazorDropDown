<h2>V1</h2>

<p>Contains just HTML, that includes a form with a select element and a submit button.</p>
<p>
    The select element has 5 options four of which relate to ‘Store’ Grades.
    Store Grades are store classifications that help parent companies manage supplies to those stores.
</p>

<p>
    Later we will be building a one to many model between two classes; Grade and Store,
    but for now we are just dealing with Grades.
</p>

<p>
    This form action will use the ‘Get’  mechanism of the http protocol to submit the selection as a query string to the
    Detail action within a controller
</p>


<form action="/v1/Details" method="get">
    <fieldset>
        Shop Grade
        <select id="Grade" name="Grade">
            <option selected="selected" value="none">-- Select--</option>
            <option value="Very Large">Very Large</option>
            <option value="Large">Large</option>
            <option value="Medium">Medium</option>
            <option value="Small">Small</option>
        </select>
        <p><input type="submit" value="Submit" /> </p>
    </fieldset>
</form>
