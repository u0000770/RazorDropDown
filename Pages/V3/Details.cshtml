    Version 3 behaves from the users perspective in the same way to version 1 and 2.
    However it introduces a ViewModel  as the mechanism for coupling the Page Model to the Views.
    The ViewModel provides strongly typed links between Page Model and views and once again uses
    abstraction to improve the testability and maintainability of our solution.
