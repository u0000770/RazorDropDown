    Version 2 introduced us to the SelectListItem class, HTML helpers and controller action input parameters – all mechanisms for abstracting aspects of the MVC framework.
</p>
<p>
    This time, I have made used the default routing rules that make available an input parameter
    of the same name as the parameter been submitted by the form.  In effect, we have begun to bind the inputs to controller actions to the
    view data independent of the mechanism used to provide that data.
